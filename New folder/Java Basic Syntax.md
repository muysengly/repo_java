### Java Basic Syntax 

| **Concept**            | **Description**                                              |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Class**              | Template/blueprint that describes behavior/state that the objects support. |
| **Object**             | Instance of a class with states and behaviors.               |
| **Methods**            | Behaviors within a class where logic is written and data is manipulated. |
| **Instance Variables** | Unique set of variables for each object, creating an object's state. |
| **Main Method**        | Entry point for any Java program. Syntax: `public static void main(String[] args)` |
| **Identifiers**        | Names for classes, variables, and methods. Must begin with a letter, `$`, or `_` |
| **Keywords**           | Reserved words in Java that may not be used as identifiers.  |
| **Case Sensitivity**   | Java is case sensitive, i.e., `Hello` and `hello` are different identifiers. |
