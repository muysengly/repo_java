Sure! Here's a summary of Java Loop Control with the syntax for different types of loops:

### Loop Types in Java:
1. **while loop**
2. **for loop**
3. **do...while loop**
4. **Enhanced for loop**

### Syntax:

1. **while loop:**
```java
while (condition) {
    // code to be executed
}
```
*Repeats a statement or group of statements while a given condition is true. It tests the condition before executing the loop body.*

2. **for loop:**
```java
for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
    // code to be executed
}
```
*Executes a sequence of statements multiple times and abbreviates the code that manages the loop variable.*

3. **do...while loop:**
```java
do {
    // code to be executed
} while (condition);
```
*Like a while statement, except that it tests the condition at the end of the loop body.*

4. **Enhanced for loop:**
```java
for (type variableName : arrayName) {
    // code to be executed
}
```
*Introduced in Java 5, mainly used to traverse collection of elements including arrays.*

### Loop Control Statements:
1. **break statement:**
   *Terminates the loop or switch statement and transfers execution to the statement immediately following the loop or switch.*

2. **continue statement:**
   *Causes the loop to skip the remainder of its body and immediately retest its condition prior to reiterating.*

Thatâ€™s the crux of it! Loops are powerful tools that let you repeat a block of code as many times as you need. ðŸš€ If you have any further questions or want examples, feel free to ask!
